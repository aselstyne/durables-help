title: Overpressurization Failsafe

The catalyst pump in the TBL Durables line striper is only rated for 2000psi, and when this operating pressure is significantly exceeded pump damage is likely to occur. As a result, the computer will instantly stop the main pump if the catalyst pressure exceeds 2300psi at any time. 

A simple (but frequent!) reason for a catalyst overpressurization is simply setting your main pressure dial too high. Always aim for a catalyst operating pressure around -----------------

### Optional: Explainer video
The following video provides an overview of how the overpressurization failsafe is engaged. 

NOTE: This video pertains to a previous iteration of the TBL Durables machine which did not include a screen. Ignore all parts related to the red light and the "low catalyst failsafe", however the rest of the video remains relevant.

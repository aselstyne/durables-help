## Explanation
The computer has detected several random drops in catalyst pressure over the last few minutes. Although you can continue working, this will cause "misses" in your line. These are spots that will never cure because catalyst didn't properly get mixed with the durables. 

This is most often due to catalyst affected by one of the following issues:
* Thick/chunky from not being sufficiently mixed
* Full of crystals from being overheated
* Had some kind of debris (like glass bead) spilled into it

To solve any of the three catalyst problems, you follow these steps

## Solutions 
### 1. Mix your catalyst
The first thing to do is ensure your catalyst is mixed well. Use the small mixing paddle to mix the catalyst in the tank on-board the machine. Ensure this mixing stick is free of debris, such as dirt or bead. Next, make sure your jugs are always well shaken by hand before pouring into the machine.

The following video explains how to properly shake a jug:

If the warning comes up again, proceed to step 2.

### 2. Drain and Replace Catalyst
If your issues persist, all catalyst will need to be removed from the machine and replaced. The following video walks you through the steps of removing the catalyst. After removing the catalyst, make sure to put well-shaken fresh catalyst back in. Dispose of the removed catalyst.

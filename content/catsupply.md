title: Catalyst Supply Issues
---
If you're experiencing this error, your catalyst pump is currently unable to consistently build pressure while you're spraying. This can be caused by a number of faults in the catalyst supply system. The following sections will walk you through solutions to a series of the faults that could cause this issue, mostly in the catalyst pump.

## Step 1: Catalyst Tank Level
The simplest and most common cause of this fault is simply that your catalyst tank has run dry.

Open your catalyst tank and see if your level is low. For this to be the cause of this issue, your tank needs to be nearly entirely empty. If your level looks fine, move on to step 2. If the level looks low, top it up with fresh, clean, and shaken catalyst.

Dump all pressures. The error message will stay on the screen, but you can repressurize the machine as normal. If the error happens again, proceed to step 2.

## Step 2: Check For Catalyst Supply

title: Catalyst Supply Issues

# <span style="color:red"> PURGE YOUR GUN NOW BEFORE READING </span>

Your catalyst pump is currently unable to consistently build pressure while you're spraying. This can be caused by a number of faults in the catalyst supply system. The following sections will walk you through all potential solutions.

## Step 1: Catalyst Tank Level
The simplest and most common cause of this fault is that your catalyst tank has run dry.

Open your catalyst tank and see if your level is low. For this to be the issue, your tank needs to be nearly entirely empty. If your level looks fine, move on to step 2. If the level looks low, top it up with fresh, clean, and shaken catalyst.

Additionally, ensure the value on the bottom of the catalyst tank is open, pointed in the downward position.

Dump all pressures. The error message will stay on the screen, but you can repressurize the machine as normal. If the error happens again, proceed to step 2.

## Step 2: Check Pump Bottom Ball and O-Rings
Occasionally, debris can get stuck in the bottom ball of the catalyst pump. Additionally, there are three small o-rings inside the pump which can wear out or tear over time. In either case, the pump will be unable to build pressure. The following videos will take you through the process of checking your bottom ball, and replacing your o-rings if needed.
